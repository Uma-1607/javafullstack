    <h3>INTRODUCTION OF CSE</h3>
    <p>Computer science is a broad and interdisciplinary field that deals with the theoretical foundations of information and computation, as well as the design and implementation of computer systems. It encompasses various areas, including algorithms, data structures, programming languages, computer architecture, operating systems, and artificial intelligence. 
Computer science heavily relies on algorithms, which are precise, step-by-step procedures for solving problems. 
These are organized ways to store and manage data, enabling efficient access and manipulation. 
These are sets of rules and syntax used to write instructions that computers can execute.
