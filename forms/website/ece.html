    <h3>INTRODUCTION OF ECE</h3>
    <p>ECE is short for Electronics and Communications Engineering, a field that deals with the design, development, and testing of electronic equipment and communication systems. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including analog and digital circuits, embedded systems, signal processing, and more. 
ECE engineers are involved in designing and developing various electronic devices, communication systems, and circuit boards. 
ECE focuses on the principles of digital and analog transmission and reception of signals, as well as working with devices like transmitters and receivers. 
ECE engineers also work with embedded systems, which are computer systems designed to perform specific functions within other devices. 
ECE involves the analysis and manipulation of signals, both analog and digital.
